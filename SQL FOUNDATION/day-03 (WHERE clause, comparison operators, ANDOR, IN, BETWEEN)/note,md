# WHERE
Now what if we wanted to filter information based on a condition? We can use the WHERE clause.

Where?

We can use the WHERE clause to filter for information based on a condition:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE id = 23;

id = 23 is the condition. Only shows with an id equal to 23 will be returned.

Here’s another example:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE year > 2020;

year > 2020 is the condition. Only the shows that were released later than 2020 will be returned.

Note: The WHERE keyword always goes after the FROM part of the query.

# Comparison Operators
Here are all the SQL comparison operators that we can use in a condition:

= equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
We use them to compare two values in the WHERE clause.
# LIKE
The LIKE operator can be used to search for a pattern in a column. It’s used in the WHERE clause:

SELECT * 
FROM shows 
WHERE name LIKE 'T%'; 

This statement filters the result to only include shows with names that begin with the letter 'T'.

The percentage sign % is a wildcard character that can be used with LIKE. You can use it to match characters to a pattern of your desired query.

The % can be used in different ways:

A% matches values that begin with letter 'A'.
%z matches values that end with 'z'.
We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

SELECT * 
FROM shows 
WHERE name LIKE '%the%'; 

Here, any show that contains the word "the" in its name will be returned.

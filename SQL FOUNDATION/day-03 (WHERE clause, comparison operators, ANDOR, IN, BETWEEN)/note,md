# WHERE
Now what if we wanted to filter information based on a condition? We can use the WHERE clause.

Where?

We can use the WHERE clause to filter for information based on a condition:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE id = 23;

id = 23 is the condition. Only shows with an id equal to 23 will be returned.

Here’s another example:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE year > 2020;

year > 2020 is the condition. Only the shows that were released later than 2020 will be returned.

Note: The WHERE keyword always goes after the FROM part of the query.

# Comparison Operators
Here are all the SQL comparison operators that we can use in a condition:

= equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
We use them to compare two values in the WHERE clause.
# LIKE
The LIKE operator can be used to search for a pattern in a column. It’s used in the WHERE clause:

SELECT * 
FROM shows 
WHERE name LIKE 'T%'; 

This statement filters the result to only include shows with names that begin with the letter 'T'.

The percentage sign % is a wildcard character that can be used with LIKE. You can use it to match characters to a pattern of your desired query.

The % can be used in different ways:

A% matches values that begin with letter 'A'.

%z matches values that end with 'z'.
We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

SELECT * 
FROM shows 
WHERE name LIKE '%the%'; 

Here, any show that contains the word "the" in its name will be returned.
BETWEEN
The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. The range must be separated by an AND keyword.

For example, this query filters the result to only include shows between the years 2020 and 2025 (inclusive):

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE year
BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025;

When the values are text, BETWEEN filters the result within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, BETWEEN filters the result to only include shows with names that begin with the letter 'A' up to 'D':

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE name
BETWEEN 'A' AND 'D';

Note: BETWEEN stops at the second letter, but doesn’t include values that begin with the second letter.

So if a show’s title is just 'D', it would be returned, whereas 'Dragon Ball Super' will not.
